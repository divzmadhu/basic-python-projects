# Countdown Timer

> "The Countdown Timer" (Basic Clock) is a simple Python program that allows the user
to enter a number of seconds, and the program counts down until it reaches zero. This
project helps beginners understand how to use loops, conditional statements, and time delays.

- Interactive Input: Prompts the user to enter the countdown duration in seconds.
- Real-Time Display: Updates the remaining time every second.
- Time's Up Notification: Displays a message when the countdown reaches zero.
- Input Validation: Ensures the user enters a valid whole number for the duration.
- Looping Functionality: Allows the user to initiate multiple countdowns without restarting the program.
